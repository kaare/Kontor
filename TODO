Programmatic

  accountsoas per outlet (replace table)
- daybook.tx
  calculate hr colspan (x + y*#banks)
- Re above, difference and banks

- Remove soa_id from gl.batches. Not needed anymore, replaced by soas per line

Later
- Kontor::Schema::Result::Gl::Accountsoa
  Set defaults for org_id. currency_id
  perhaps even globally in Kontor::Schema, like
  has 'org_id' => (), has 'currency_id' => ()

  Set defaults for periodnr for balances creation

  Perhaps use a (not yet created) balance method in Kontor::Schema::Result::Gl::Acctgrid

- Rewrite gl sql functions get_dimensions, get_acctnr

Shortcuts
- accountsoas, hardcoded periodnr
  Should be set on login?
